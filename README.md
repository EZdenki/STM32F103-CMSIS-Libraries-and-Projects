## STM32F103 (Blue Pill) CMSIS Libraries and Projects
Here you will find basic libraries and simple project to help you get started in programming the STM32F103 (Blue Pill).<br>

## Getting Started
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-Setup](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-Setup)<br>
A step-by-step guide to setting up your Windows or GNU/Linux PC to program the STM32F103 using CMSIS (no STM32CubeIDE HAL) and the editor of your choice. Takes you from zero to blinky!
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-Blinky](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-Blinky)<br>
Minimalist Blinky program for the STM32F103 / Blue Pill using only CMSIS.

## USART (RS-232 Serial IO) Library and Projects
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-USART-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-USART-lib)<br>
A very simple USART library to provide serial IO functionality via a serial terminal like PuTTY for Windows or minCom for GNU/Linux. Includes a simple program that demostrates basic keyboard/display input output functionality.<br>
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-EEPROM-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-EEPROM-lib)<br>
A simple EEPROM monitor that allows reading and writing to a 24LC64 I2C EEPROM via a serial terminal.

## I2C Library and Projects
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-lib)<br>
Basic I2C routines for the STM32F103 (Blue Pill) using only CMSIS. This is the library only. See below for sample I2C projects.
+ [STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-AHT10-lib)<br>
AHT10 library and sample project to read temp and humidity and disiplay them along with "heat index" on an I2C driven 16x2 LCD.
+ [https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-EEPROM-lib](https://github.com/sandynomike/STM32F103-CMSIS-I2C-EEPROM-lib)<br>
A simple EEPROM monitor that allows reading and writing to a 24LC64 I2C EEPROM via a serial terminal.
